## Deploying a Go API on heroku

## To deploy it on heroku.

I'll assume you have heroku cli installed and logged in.
or you can start here.
[Install heroku cli](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)

- Create a Procfile that points to our binary with one line
  and place it in the root of the directory

```
// Profile
web: bin/Intersect_api
```

- Run the app locally to test using

```
heroku local
```

- Create a heroku app

```
heroku create intersect-api-v2
```

- Then commit our changes on git

```
git add .
git commit -m 'ðŸ’ª'
```

- And at the end, simply deploy our app using

```
git push heroku heroku-deploy:master
```

- (Optional) Subsequent change can be commit using

```
git push heroku master
```

Extra

- You can read the logs from with

```
heroku logs
```

That's about it.
Now we can check our server at with the valid headers,

https://intersect-api-v2.herokuapp.com
