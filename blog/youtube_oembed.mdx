The basic HTTP request looks like thisâ€¦

    [http://youtube.com/oembed?url=${YOUR](http://youtube.com/oembed?url=${YOUR)_VIDEO_URL}&format=json

Gives us a response like thisâ€¦

```json
    {
    "title": "Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up (Video)",
    "author_name": "RickAstleyVEVO",
    "author_url": "[https://www.youtube.com/user/RickAstleyVEVO](https://www.youtube.com/user/RickAstleyVEVO)",
    "type": "video",
    "height": **113**,
    "width": **200**,
    "version": "1.0",
    "provider_name": "YouTube",
    "provider_url": "[https://www.youtube.com/](https://www.youtube.com/)",
    "thumbnail_height": **360**,
    "thumbnail_width": **480**,
    "thumbnail_url": "[https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dQw4w9WgXcQ/hqdefault.jpg](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dQw4w9WgXcQ/hqdefault.jpg)",
    "html": "<iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
    }
```

Thatâ€™s pretty neat :]
