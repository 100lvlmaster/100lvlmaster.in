# Create a PWA with Sveltekit | Svelte

I've been using sveltekit and svelte for over a year now. I'm also anxiously waiting for it to be matured enought to beat NextJs in terms of community. But I like them both.

So, on this weekend I wanted to turn one of my projects into a PWA. When I wanted to do with NextJs projects there were a lot of tutorials. But I couldn't find many guides for svelte beginners.

That's because svelte has pwa functionality built into it.

## Note !

### Basic things for all PWAs

- A website
- manifest.json [ basic icons,names,shortcuts]
- service-worker [ for offline cache ]

So let's get on with it.

## First:

We'll create a demo Sveltekit project:

```bash
npm init svelte@next my-app
```

Then we'll choose a simple config in vite for the sake of this article:

Choose typescript because ts >>>> js:

Now we have a demo project setup with typescript, it will be straight-forward from here on:

Let's get into our directory:

```bash
cd my-app
```

And run:

```bash
yarn
```

After that,

- In the /static directory, We'll create a manifest.json.
- When svelte compiles the whole application the static files will be copied over to the build folder.

Then we'll refer our `manifest.json` in `src/app.html`.

And finally we'll create our `src/service-worker.ts`

_Svelte will automatically detect the service-worker in the src folder's root and then register our service worker during build_.
_Isn't that neat?_

Now we just need to build or app using `yarn build`:

Now we can preview our build using `yarn preview`:

'0' is that a _'install app'_ button,

Svelte makes it easy to make PWAs.
