# The VS code dark theme I've been waiting for

![One for all â€” A VS Code theme ðŸš€](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*QRBOGYO-lO6JhQDC.png)

I was browsing through the Visual Studio Code marketplace, looking for a dark theme.

Iâ€™ve been through that conundrum before though Iâ€™ve always settled on One dark pro. Sure, itâ€™s nice and pretty eye pleasing but i need something with more consistent colors.

## So I made a VS Code theme, well actually two.

These are the things i wanted from One dark pro:-

- Consistent colors.

- Getting rid of that very distracting orange color in the status bar when debugging.

- An option to a slightly more darker shade if i felt like it.

- Slightly darker but more lighter blues

- Minimal colors across the editor

Iâ€™ve switched lot of themes, A LOT. To the point where i was just installing the same themes again and again. That felt very unproductive :(
